# Automatic_Waste_Segregation_System
this project is Arduino based Waste Segregation system. first the user drop the waste to the inlet. the system then detects the presence of waste using IR Proximity Sensor. then the waste passes through conveyor belt. while transporting through the conveyor belt,the system detectes the type of waste whether it is dry, moist or metalic waste. after detecting, it automatically segregates into three dedicated compartments.
